   <h1>Spity Vally</h1>
   <p>Monasteries
    Spiti Valley is home to several ancient monasteries, including Key Monastery, Tabo Monastery, and Dhankar Monastery. Key Monastery is the largest monastery in the valley, and overlooks the Spiti River. Tabo Monastery is the oldest monastery in the region, built in 999 AD. Dhankar Monastery is perched on a cliff and offers stunning views.
    Trekking
    The 55 km Spiti Valley Trek is a 5-day expedition that covers the valleys of Kaza, Langza, Komik, Demul, Dhankar, and Lalung.
    Natural beauty
    Spiti Valley is surrounded by the Himalayan mountains, and features high mountain passes, blue lakes, and waterfalls. Chandrataal Lake is known for its crescent shape. 
    Travelers can enter Spiti Valley from Shimla or Manali, and can take state-run buses or private taxis to Kaza, the valley's sub-divisional headquarter. Indian citizens don't need a permit to enter the valley. </p>
